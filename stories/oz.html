            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><font size="2">A wizard of
                knowledge that cared for us kids<br>
                Saw need in the world for a change,<br>
                For the minds of the youths were all starving and
                weak<br>
                &#145;Cause they found creativity strange.<br>
                So the wizard took wand (and some funding of
                course)<br>
                And kazaamed up a kingdom ideal<br>
                In which subjects could grow and create and
                relate<br>
                Far away from the world they called
                &quot;Real.&quot;<br>
                </font><p><font size="2">Those that fled to the
                realm, that we&#146;ll simply call OZ<br>
                For the lack of a letter or two,<br>
                Found a place where their minds could take flight
                with their dreams<br>
                And officials whose motives were true.<br>
                Here they worked and they played and discovered
                themselves<br>
                And the tools that they&#146;d need later on<br>
                In their lives as adults in the world of concrete<br>
                To whose betterment all had been sworn. <br>
                So the kingdom was held as a bright, shining star<br>
                To whose level the &quot;Real&quot; world should
                raise,<br>
                And the cold calculation of capitalism<br>
                Should accept creativity&#146;s blaze. <br>
                </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Thus the tree that was OZ was
                well rooted and held<br>
                By the altruist wizard and co.<br>
                And the seeds from it fell into minds that sought
                nurture<br>
                And gorged as horizons did grow. <br>
                And as years passed the word of the wonders of OZ<br>
                Did spread to the lands far and wide,<br>
                And its membership grew to be vast and diverse<br>
                And its message was shouted and cried.<br>
                But as OZ became structured to hold all the
                weight,<br>
                A colossal bureaucracy formed,<br>
                And the small minds that thrive on destruction
                through structure<br>
                Saw vuln&#146;rable corpus and swarmed.<br>
                </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">They saw OZ as a thing and a
                game they could Win<br>
                And they wanted to win at all cost,<br>
                So they ruled and defined and restricted the kids<br>
                Until all the ideals were lost.<br>
                As this plague seeped and sullied the once-haven
                OZ<br>
                It left barren the land in its wake<br>
                And the scribes that wrote problems and judges
                that judged<br>
                Did their love for the children forsake.<br>
                &#145;Twas the System that now was the cause
                paramount<br>
                And priority first on the mind.<br>
                Thus the &quot;real world&quot; had won with its
                ideals stark<br>
                And had turned OZ into one of its kind.<br>
                </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">For the few that saw truth of
                the death of the land<br>
                They tried hard to bring sight to the rest,<br>
                But the cries of the Knights in the night of
                inane<br>
                Couldn&#146;t open the eyes tightly pressed.<br>
                So they mourned as fair OZ into darkness did
                slide<br>
                And they cried for the children that fell<br>
                Into limbo with no one to guide them or love them<br>
                And give them a haven to dwell.</font></p>
