        for writers</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Stain Killer</b> </dt>
            <dd>My Ft. Campbell, KY High School Classics team was
                working hard before regionals; two of the girls
                were painting away on the backdrop when somebody
                knocked over the bottle of green acrylic paint
                onto the blue carpet of the school.<p>Fearing the
                wrath of the principal, the two girls go out
                searching for carpet cleaner. They lay hold of an
                aerosol can which has in big letters, &quot;Stain
                Killer&quot;, so they start spraying the carpet
                with the contents of the can. I walk into the
                room, ignorant of the whole episode, see these
                girls spraying the carpet with this can.
                &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; I yelled. They
                told me the story of the green paint and they
                were trying to get up the spot with this
                &quot;Stain Killer.&quot; </p>
                <p>I then told them to read the fine print on the
                can. It's a stain killer for rust... it's primer
                paint. They had used almost half the can on the
                carpet. I was very surprised when they took first
                at regionals later that week. The principal is
                still unhappy, though. </p>

            <dt><b>A Tale of Two Teams</b> </dt>
            <dd>In 1990 my 2nd daughter, Erynn, then in the 3rd
                grade, became involved in OM and pulled me in as
                the coach. The problem that was given to them was
                the balsa wood structure problem. I had had 1 1/2
                years college level training in civil engineering
                before I found my true career, computers, so I
                felt qualified to coach the problem. The first
                thing I had to learn, however, was what is
                Outside Assistance. Since I couldn't tell the
                kids how to design the structure, I would find
                material for them to study. Great Idea, except
                there isn't anything out there below the college
                level which tells how to design structures. I dug
                out my old books from years gone by and taught
                the kids about Euler's Formula and a version of
                the slenderness ratio which I translated to their
                level and called Critical Length. <p>We started
                in a complete vacuum in that we had never seen an
                OM tournament before, and more importantly, what
                other teams' structures of years past had looked
                like. The kids came up with a design which turned
                out to be much different than all the rest. We
                also learned about wood density and jigs and many
                other construction techniques. Throughout all
                this my first daughter Aimee, who was a freshman
                in high school, helped coach the team. </p>
                <p>The team was a real screamer. They placed 3rd
                at the regional tournament. At state they placed
                3rd in weight held, but by way of a super strong
                spontaneous, they came 5 point from going to
                World. It was a great year for all. </p>
                <p>Aimee became interested in the process, so I
                promised her that if she got a team together, I
                would coach it. Six of the first team came back
                in '91 to do it again, so I found myself with 2
                structure teams. I asked the State Problem
                Captain if the 2 daughters could talk about their
                solutions and got back an emphatic
                &quot;NO!&quot; I was told that if any ideas
                transferred between the teams, it would be
                outside assistance. My wife, Su, agreed to be the
                assistant coach even though she had a team of her
                own. We held one team meeting on Saturday and one
                on Sunday. The girls were almost religious about
                not talking OM, except for spontaneous. </p>
                <p>To give a little back ground on these 2
                daughters, I will have to tell you that they are
                like twins 7 years apart. They look alike, talk
                alike and more importantly to this issue, they
                think alike. They both became the team lead.
                Aimee had seen the structure from the younger
                daughter's team in '90, so they had the same
                beginning. It was uncanny to watch the teams
                develop their ideas. A few weeks into the season
                I could predict what the younger team was going
                to do by what the older one had done the week
                before. We became very conscious of how we might
                influence the teams' thought process and worked
                hard to avoid it. At one point, though, to avoid
                what we saw as a problem, we considered leading
                one team or the other away from that design, but
                decided that that really would have been OA. </p>
                <p>Half way through the season when we saw the
                parallelism developing I began cautioning the
                teams to &quot;Remember where you got your ideas
                and how you built the structure.&quot; This is
                also when I began writing a paper on OM structure
                design and I taught the teams the same material.
                They were exposed to the same information, the
                same beginning and they developed almost the same
                solution. As we neared the tournament the 2
                structures were so identical that at 30' you
                couldn't tell them apart, and they were much
                different from the traditional design. </p>
                <p>Three weeks before the regional tournament it
                was obvious that the teams would have to go to 2
                days a week, meaning that I was going to have to
                coach them together. Their designs were
                completely developed and they were working on
                construction techniques. I asked them both
                &quot;Are you happy with your design?&quot; Both
                teams said that they were. I told them that they
                had to finalize it because the next week they
                were going to see the other team's structure, and
                they could not use anything they saw in their
                solution. It was a mute point because there were
                only minor differences. When they saw the other
                team's work they were as flabbergasted as we had
                been. </p>
                <p>On the day of the tournament, the younger team
                went first. Their structure caught a lot of
                attention because it was so different from others
                the judges had seen. They queried the team
                members thoroughly about its design and
                construction. Two hours later the high school
                team came in for inspection. The first thing the
                head judge said was &quot;This looks a lot like
                another structure we saw earlier.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; my daughter said. &quot;My
                sister's team was here earlier and our structures
                are a lot alike.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;And who is your coach?&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;My dad coached both teams.&quot; They
                had instructions to be as honest and open as they
                knew how. </p>
                <p>I was waiting for the younger team to come out
                of spontaneous when the State Problem Captain
                came down the hall. She is a large and imposing
                woman and struck fear into even my heart. I have
                come to know her quite well since and appreciate
                the great service she has given, but that year
                she was not the person I wanted to see. &quot;We
                need to talk to you in the inspection room when
                you are available.&quot; she told me. </p>
                <p>&quot;I'll be there in 15 minutes, if you can
                wait for me.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;We'll see you then in 15 minutes in the
                inspection room.&quot; </p>
                <p>When the team came out I took them to the
                school cafeteria and found a couple of parents to
                keep them there. Su and I headed for the meeting.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;You'll have to see this from our
                viewpoint and other coach's viewpoints.&quot; she
                began. In the back of my mind I saw a huge OA
                penalty for each team. Su and I talked for 20
                minutes explaining why the 2 structures were so
                much alike, but I didn't feel that we had
                convinced them. </p>
                <p>&quot;Why don't you talk to the kids?&quot; I
                suggested. </p>
                <p>&quot;We'd like to do that.&quot; she replied.
                I went to the cafeteria to get the team and ran
                into Aimee on the way. </p>
                <p>&quot;Get your team together and stay in the
                cafeteria. You're going to have to talk to the
                judges.&quot; She ran off to find the others. </p>
                <p>I brought in the team and introduced them to
                the judges and sat back to listen. The judges
                were great. They were understanding and listened
                as the kids spoke. One of the most thrilling
                moments of my OM life was when one 4th grade boy,
                who was normally quite shy, spoke up and
                explained Euler's Formula to the judge and how
                they had used it to design the structure. He had
                his own twist to it, and if we had gone no
                farther than that moment, it would have all been
                worth it. </p>
                <p>Aimee had 6 of the other team waiting when we
                finished and they went in to meet with the
                judging staff. Su and I couldn't stay to listen
                because her team of 2nd graders was going on
                stage for their long term performance. I returned
                at 4:00 PM to get the results. </p>
                <p>&quot;No penalty. They are certainly well
                coached, but I recommend that you don't coach 2
                teams in the same problem anymore.&quot; was the
                response from the Regional Problem Captain. I
                wondered for the rest of that year and into the
                next exactly what he meant by that. </p>
                <p>The next year Aimee decided to be a judge. At
                that time they had a lower age limit than they do
                now and she was quite welcome because of here
                first hand experience. She came home from one of
                the training sessions with an interesting finish
                to the story. One of the other judges was
                explaining OA to her and told her that &quot;Last
                year we really grilled 2 teams for outside
                assistance.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;I know.&quot; she replied. &quot;I was
                on one of those teams.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;Who's your father?&quot; he asked. She
                told him. &quot;At the start of that day he was a
                dark, dark, figure. How could someone do
                something like that to 2 teams? By the time we
                got done talking to your team he was a saint. I
                would like to shake his hand.&quot; </p>
                <p>That was my introduction into coach's
                training. I have since finished the paper on
                structure design for OMers and it has been used
                in Colorado OM training since. Aimee took a real
                interest in talking with the team members as they
                came through inspection and asked them where they
                learned how to build a structure. The interesting
                thing about that paper is that every team that
                has beaten one of mine has used that paper for
                their technical information. </p>
                <p>I have stayed away from judging and limited my
                activities in training because coaching is what I
                want to do the most. One of the girls on the
                younger team gave me one of my most memorable
                moments about half way through that season. Marie
                was a real bright girl, and very attractive. She
                had learned that if she shrugged cutely and said
                &quot;I don't know.&quot; when asked a question,
                she didn't have to participate. But she was
                always paying attention from the back of the
                group. </p>
                <p>One day the team and I were working in the
                basement. Two boys were building one of their
                jigs and were slaughtering a 1x2 and the miter
                box it was mounted in. Time was short and I was
                really frustrated. Marie was watching.
                &quot;Marie, you haven't done this yet.&quot; I
                took the saw from the boys and gave it to her.
                &quot;Here, you try it.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;I don't know how to do that.&quot; she
                said with her typical shrug. </p>
                <p>&quot;It's time to learn.&quot; I said as I
                nudged her toward the bench with the board
                clamped in the miter box. She took the saw and
                whacked the board off like a professional. She
                had been paying attention and had absorbed all
                the instruction I had been pouring out on the
                boys. &quot;That's great! You've been hiding that
                talent from us all this time!&quot; </p>
                <p>Just then Su called from the top of the stairs
                saying that Marie's mother was there to pick her
                up. As she went up the stairs she beamed with
                excitement. &quot;Mrs. Whitchurch, I have talent
                even I didn't know I had!&quot; That was our key
                to her for the rest of the season and she became
                one of the most active participants on the team. </p>
                <p>OM is about empowerment. Teaching kids what
                they can do has been real thrilling. Including
                the teams my wife and I have coached together, we
                are on our 16th team this year. I have a real
                bone which I pick from time to time with one of
                our regional directors when he assesses an OA
                penalty just because he doesn't believe the kids
                are capable of certain things. I'm glad that my
                team this year is not in his region because, if
                things work well, they are going to raise
                eyebrows. I coach &quot;hard&quot; and expect a
                lot out of my teams. I ALWAYS work to build their
                self confidence by using positive comments like
                &quot;You're a bright kid and I think you can do
                better than that.&quot; Last year I witnessed an
                unbelievable transformation in our 'team clown'
                when I told him &quot;You're smarter than you
                think you are.&quot; </p>
                <p>I have learned a lot about my own relationship
                with my son. We have had problems working
                together in Boy Scouts and these same problems
                became intensified in OM. It is what we have
                called for years &quot;The Coach's Kid
                Syndrome.&quot; That's when the coach looks
                around and sees that the worst behaving team
                member is his(hers). My son and I are just now
                getting to the point where we can work together
                without &quot;pushing each other's buttons.&quot;
                I demand the same respect he would give to a
                teacher and give him the same treatment I give to
                other team members. He started in the middle of
                last summer on a solution to the Baloonacy
                problem based upon the preliminary description.
                It has been real rocky working with him because
                of the CKS, but we have finally worked through
                it. It will carry back to Boy Scouts and
                everything else that he and I do together. </p>
                <p>In closing I want to say that I feel that the
                Outside Assistance rule and its strict, far
                reaching interpretation is the reason OM is so
                successful. Making the kids learn and do the work
                and keeping it from becoming a competition
                between parents returns tremendous rewards. If
                the coach(s) can connect with what the kids
                already know and build from there, there is no
                real limit to what they can do. It always thrills
                me to have a kid come back for a second year and
                see how much different (s)he is from the year
                before. Even if they don't succeed, they will
                learn something from trying. </p>
