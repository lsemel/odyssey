        The Weather from Iowa</font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="450"><br>
        The Iowa weather seemed to follow the events of the
        Division I CRUNCH! team I took to Iowa and share our
        emotions. The cold, wet and slightly ominous weather of
        our arrival seemed to foretell of some mis-adventure.
        Sure enough, when my co-coach (Bob Pearson) picked up the
        props, he discovered that one of the boxes was missing.
        After several hours on the phone, it became clear there
        was no chance the box could be found and delivered in
        time. <p>I like the analogy of OM competitions being like
        a &quot;thought marathon&quot;. For most marathoners, the
        PROCESS of training for the race, tracking their
        &quot;personal best&quot; times and being with people who
        enjoy this same activity on race day is the motivation
        for their running. The box of lost props might be
        compared to shoe laces breaking a few moments before a
        race. </p>
        <p>We presented the situation to the kids and asked what
        they wanted to do. They could have moaned about &quot;bad
        luck&quot;. They could have become depressed and opted to
        &quot;scratch&quot; themselves from the race. Instead, to
        my great pride, they instantly and unanimously said they
        wanted to try to rebuild the missing props. </p>
        <p>That day was clear, mild and pleasant. We decided to
        approach rebuilding the missing props like a spontaneous
        problem. We told the team they should spend and hour or
        two brain-storming, creating a list of desired materials
        and dividing the necessary activities among themselves.
        Like a Spontaneous, they should plan on limiting their
        building activity to a fixed amount of time and STOP when
        time was called. We admonished the parents that mis-haps
        like this did nothing to alter the rules against Outside
        Assistance and assigned a parent and/or coach to work
        with each group. </p>
        <p>One group went &quot;dumpster diving&quot; to collect
        raw materials. I took one team member to the hardware
        store to purchase tools and materials they'd identified.
        My wife and co-coach (Ellen Hartzler) stayed with a group
        re-assembling the props that had arrived whole. </p>
        <p>This team has been a dream to coach. They work well
        together, are very creative and always seem to have fun.
        At the end of 5-6 hours, all the missing props were
        completely reconstructed better, in my opinion, than the
        originals. For me, this was the highlight of my coaching
        experience. Instead of opting out of the race when their
        laces broke, they fashioned new ones from the available
        materials and went on with the race without missing a
        step! </p>
        <p>Friday mornings weather was highly unsettled -- the
        wind was gusting and the clouds promised something
        exciting. The team was the first to compete that day and
        the 8 A.M. start time left the facility ominously quiet.
        Weigh-in came and went without surprises -- the first
        hurdle was passed. The props were moved to the staging
        area and the team received their instructions from the
        judges. As time began, the two boys who moved the weights
        and retrieved the balls (Matt Pearson and Kyle Anixter)
        moved like a well-oiled machine. When they they did their
        second 2-ball CRUNCH (at a little over 300 pounds weight
        held), a piece of the structure sprang several feet away
        onto the floor -- but the structure held. From that point
        on, I expected every weight placed and every ball dropped
        to be accompanied by the loud CRASH of a collapsing
        structure -- but the only sounds were those of the team
        calmly going about their business. </p>
        <p>One of the style elements was to create a ball
        retrieval device. The team had created a very effective
        system from an old vacuum cleaner. They went on to use
        the exhaust from the vacuum to pump air into boxes with
        decorated trash bags attached to the top -- so as the
        play went on, these bags filled to create characters that
        were part of the play. Near the end, a battle takes place
        between these inflatable characters and the
        &quot;heroes&quot; of the play. Unfortunately, there was
        no way to practice this aspect of the play without
        destroying the prop. At one point, while Matt and I were
        stacking a weight, I heard a loud &quot;POP&quot; and
        looked over to see that one of the team members (Katie
        Donnovan) &quot;fighting&quot; with the inflatable
        characters has decided to &quot;do in&quot; her opponent
        by knocking him down and jumping on him! Keep in mind
        that the whole time Katie is demolishing the prop at one
        end, Kyle is still using it to extract balls from against
        the structure from the other! </p>
        <p>After 9 additional 45 pound weights (and seven more
        2-ball CRUNCHs), the side of the structure where the
        piece had flown finally cracked -- but the structure
        still held! Matt and I collected one last 45 pound weight
        and as we were about to place it, the structure
        collapsed. I looked up to see the team member who played
        the evil thief (Grant Cole) lying among the ruins of his
        inflatable henchmen while Katie and the other hero
        character (played by Ewin Chao) were performing the
        closing scene. The structure had held 710 pounds -- 180
        pounds more than any previous structure and the play and
        structure ended at the exact same time. It simply doesn't
        get any better than that! The non-performing team members
        (Patty Allen and Melody Thompson) rushed out and
        celebrated with their team-mates. </p>
        <p>At that moment, I was as proud as any coach could be.
        The team had rallied from adversity, not simply to finish
        the race, but to finish it with their &quot;personal
        best&quot; effort! No matter what happened, I knew this
        team would be able to feel wonderfully about how they had
        done. I don't know about most coaches, but my wishes
        focus on everything going smoothly rather than on the
        final outcome of the competition. I always tell the kids
        (and firmly believe myself) that the only thing the team
        can control in an OM competition is their own
        performance. This team had certainly done the best they
        could -- I knew they would feel proud. </p>
        <p>The Spontaneous element of the competition took place
        in the afternoon -- accompanied by a quiet, gentle rain.
        Saturday was spent cheering for fellow CA teams, trying
        to catch up on the pin trading they missed while by
        rebuilding their props and waiting for the closing
        ceremonies. If a Ranatra Fusca is to be announced, it was
        done between the announcement of the second and first
        place teams. It's impossible to describe the feeling of
        hearing our teams ball retrieval device described as the
        winner of the Ranatra Fusca Award. It is pretty much a
        blur from there, but some time during the long run to the
        stage to pick up the Ranatra Fusca Award, they announced
        that our team had won first place as well! </p>
        <p>The next morning the sky was clear and the air calm.
        As we unloaded the luggage to check in for the plane, I
        saw the rising sun use the few remaining wisps of clouds
        as the canvas for one of the most beautiful sun rises
        I've ever seen. I expect my feet will touch ground some
        time in the next week or so -- but it hasn't happened
        yet. Needless to say, the whole adventure is one we will
        not soon forget. </p>
