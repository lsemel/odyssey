        OMers select one of five long-term problems to work on
        each year. Here are the 1996-97 long-term problem
        synopses. To get the full specifications, you've got to
        buy a membership. <p>

		<font size="5">Pageant Wagon</font></p>
        <p>
		The team’s problem is to design and build a Tow Vehicle and a 		Pageant Wagon, and to present a festive performance that includes humor and a Grand Finale. The Tow Vehicle will be powered and driven by a team members(s) and will tow or push the Pageant Wagon around a course. The Tow Vehicle and the Pageant Wagon will carry all of the team’s props.  The Pageant Wagon will be used as part of the set for the performance. During the performance, the Tow Vehicle will travel the course and show off, which includes performing a task, to attract interest in the Pageant Wagon. In addition, the Pageant Wagon will accomplish a task that will be part of the Grand Finale. The time limit is 8 minutes. Materials used cannot exceed a $100 (U.S.) value (Divisions I, II, III, and IV)  </p>
        <p><font size="5">Morph Magic</font></p>
        <p>
		To solve this problem, the team is to create and present a humorous performance that includes a character who undergoes
   a morph from a human to an animal. The character will either find some plight as an animal that it will help or, when in
   animal form, find something to make the human's life better. The performance must also include a team-made device that
   will morph from its original appearance into something else. In addition, all of the team's props must fit inside a limited
   space. The time limit is 8 minutes. Materials used cannot exceed a $100 (U.S.) value (Divisions II, III, IV) </p>
        <p><font size="5">Classics.......Marvelous Mentor</font></p>
        <p>
		For this problem, the team is to create and present a performance about an advertising agency that has been
   commissioned to make a television commercial about a product that is nutritious. During the performance, the agency has
   the good fortune to have an acclaimed individual as a mentor for the project. The performance will include music, humor
   and the team's presentation of its television commercial. The team will also design a package for the product. In addition,
   all of the team's props must fit inside a limited space. The time limit is 8 minutes. Materials used cannot exceed a $100
   (U.S.) value. (Divisions I, II, III, IV) </p>
        <p><font size="5">Camouflaged Creation</font></p>
        <p>
		This problem requires teams to design, build and test a Camouflaged Structure made of balsa wood and glue. The
   Camouflaged Structure may be stained and/or painted and will be part of a Larger Creation made by the team. During the
   performance the team will remove the Camouflaged Structure from the Larger Creation, then test it by having it balance
   and support as much weight as possible. The team must also create and present a theme for the performance. In addition,
   all of the team's props must fit inside a limited space. The time limit is 8 minutes. Materials used cannot exceed a $100
   (U.S.) value. (Divisions I, II, III, IV.</p>
        <p><font size="5">Create & Animate</font></p>
        <p>
		For this problem, the team will create and present a humorous performance where an inanimate object comes to life. The
   performance will also include music and a team-created poem or song. In addition, all of the team's props must fit within a
   limited space. The time limit is 8 minutes. Materials used cannot exceed a $90 (U.S.) value (Divisions I, II)  </p>

<!--
        <p><font size="5">The Good News</font></p>
        <p>he team's problem is to create and present a
        television news broadcast that includes three stories. At
        some time during the performance, the team must show the
        good in something that is usually bad. The presentation
        must include at least one humorous news anchor and a
        simulation of a live news clip. The time limit is 8
        minutes. Materials used cannot exceed a $50 (U.S.) value.
        (Primary, Grades K-3) </p>
