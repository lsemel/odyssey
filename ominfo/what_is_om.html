        Odyssey of the Mind is a world-wide, nonprofit
        organization that promotes creative team-based problem
        solving in a school program for students from
        kindergarten through college. It features an annual
        competition component at local through international
        levels. Students solve problems in a variety of
        areas--from building mechanical devices such as
        spring-driven vehicles to giving their own interpretation
        of literary classics. Through solving problems, students
        learn life-long skills such as working with others as a
        team, evaluating ideas, making decisions, and creating
        solutions while also developing self-confidence from
        their experiences. The program helps students learn
        divergent thinking and problem solving skills while
        participating in a series of challenging and motivating
        activities, both inside and outside their regular
        classroom curriculum. <p>Odyssey of the Mind was featured
        on television's <i>Creativity with Bill Moyers</i> and <i>I,
        Leonardo: A Journey of the Mind</i>, and in many
        publications, most recently <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i>.</p>
        <p><font size="5">How Does It Work?</font></p>
        <p>Working under the guidance of coaches, teams of five
        to seven students develop solutions to problems and are
        given the opportunity to test their creative solutions
        against those of other teams. New problems are designed
        each year and allow for competition in four divisions.
        Participation in Divisions I, II, and II is determined by
        age. Division IV is for participants in college or the
        military. In competition, teams are judged in three
        areas: the effectiveness of the solution to the long-term
        problem (200 points); the style of the solution and its
        overall effect (50 points); and the solution to a <a
        href="../spont/spontaneous.html"><b>spontaneous</b></a>
        problem given to the teams on competition day (100
        points). OM chartered associations' local, regional,
        state/provincial competitions culminate in the Odyssey of
        the Mind World Finals held annually in late May or early
        June. Competing teams represent top finishers in each
        U.S. state and many nations. More than 700 student teams
        (totaling nearly 5,000 students) participate along with
        their coaches. In addition, over 300 adults help
        officiate the four-day event. The estimated attendance at
        World Finals is 14,000. </p>
        <p><font size="5">Who Participates?</font></p>
        <p>When the program began in 1978, 28 New Jersey schools
        participated. Today, more than one million students
        participate. There are member schools in all 50 states,
        the District of Columbia, and many other countries as
        diverse as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England,
        Germany, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. </p>
