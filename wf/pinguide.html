        We all know that the World Finals brings out some of the
        most competitive kids in the world. But when the eight
        minutes is up, and spontaneous is complete, it's time for
        the real competition: pin trading. In this spirit we
        bring you...</p>
        <p align="center"><font size="6">Matt's Pin Trading Guide</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="4">Pins: An Introduction</font></p>
        <p><img src="ptg-maryland.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
        width="100" height="104">For those of you who are going
        to the worlds, prepare yourselves. Outside of the
        competition itself, pin trading is the most popular word
        finals activity. Kids from all over the world trade OM
        pins from their own state, province, or country, with
        other kids. It's a great activity.</p>
        <p><font size="4">How big is pin trading?</font> </p>
        <p>It's huge! Everywhere you look pins are being traded
        at the Worlds. We know there are about 750 teams, with
        about 6.75 members each, on average. That gives us 5063
        pin-hungry OMers. Now, for every kid there are about 1.5
        supporters. That gives us about 12,700 people. Now if we
        forget about officials, and each person brings about
        thirty-five new pins, that's 445,000 new pins! This
        doesn't even account for old pins that people are
        bringing back. There could be up to a million pins at the
        World Finals! That means that one to two million dollars
        in pins will be found at College Park!</p>
        <p><font size="4">Trading Ethics</font> </p>
        <p>Sometimes it seems like pin trading is more
        competitive than the OM competition itself. This has its
        advantages and disadvantages. Coming up with a successful
        pin idea, producing it, and trading it is a fun,
        creative, and rewarding problem in and of itself. Pin
        trading lets you meet people, make friends, and practice
        your business skills. There are many approaches to pin
        trading, from friendly trading to intense, cutthroat
        dealmaking. Perhaps the variety of ways trading can be
        approached accounts for its popularity.</p>
        <p>Pin trading is supposed to bring you together with
        people from around the world. The idea is to meet people
        and make friends. Even though we're all supposed to get
        along, it often seems that pin trading is not in the
        spirit of OM at all. So watch out for those who try to
        take advantage of you, and don't take advantage of
        others.</p>
        <p>It is considered 'against the rules' to buy pins
        during the competition, unless you're buying more of your
        own state's pins to replenish your supply. And nobody
        will trade pins for anything but other pins.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Preparation</font> </p>
        <p>There are two things you need to start pin trading:
        pins and something to put them on. You'll want to contact
        your state OM association to purchase this year's pins.
        It may cost a lot of money, so start fundraising right
        away. If you want something really special you can make
        your own pins. However, if you want to do this do it NOW
        because it takes a couple of weeks. Contact me for
        companies to make them for you. As for what you put them
        on, you can start small and work your way up. Some people
        use handkerchiefs, small towels, or washcloths. Other
        people make pin books, which are good because they hold
        your pins, but create the problem that you can't show off
        your collection all at once. I recommend a simple piece
        of felt in a dark color. It's sturdy enough to hold a lot
        of pins, it's nice to touch, and it won't show dirt like
        a white towel would. So cut yourself a nice piece, put
        your pins on it, and get trading!</p>
        <p><img src="ptg-shanghai.jpg" align="left" hspace="10"
        width="70" height="67">How many pins should you bring?
        The more pins you bring, the more trading you can do. You
        don't want to run out of pins in the middle of the
        competition. I've heard sixty pins as a suggested amount.
        Almost all of your pins should be OM pins, as this is the
        OM World Finals and other pins have little value. You
        should have two or three different kinds of pins.</p>
        <p>When you meet Omer, give him your pin by pinning it on
        his shirt, and it'll become part of OM's permanent pin
        collection, which is usually put on display sometime
        during the competition.</p>
        <p><font size="4">The History of Pins</font> </p>
        <p>When I started trading, back in 1991 in Knoxville,
        every state had a simple pin. It was no larger than two
        inches, had one backing, and was never more than one
        piece. A year later, in Colorado, some progress was made
        with multi-backing pins. This amazing new feature kept
        the pin more secure and ensured that it would remain in
        the exact position you wanted. Moreover, the first
        flashing pin was made by New Hampshire, though it was
        really a button. The flashing pin scene quickly faded
        away by 1994. However, pin history was made in 1993 in
        Maryland when Iowa introduced the first two part pin. It
        was a version of the Grant Wood painting, American
        Gothic, with pigs in place of the farmers. The multi-part
        pin scene exploded. Every state needed to have more than
        one piece to their pins. So now, pins are always divided
        up into multiple parts, which somehow increases their
        value.</p>
        <p><img src="ptg-lion.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
        width="60" height="126"> Also introduced in that
        monumental year was the first chain pin. Two pins were
        connected with a flimsy chain, also increasing its value.
        Now at the world finals you can find the multi-backed,
        chained, five-piece pin. I think it has stolen the beauty
        from the world of pin trading, but what can I do? Anyway,
        when you trade, get the whole set. You'll be really angry
        when you show your friends Ben Franklin flying his
        invisible kite.</p>
        <p>A new innovation found at the 1996 World Finals was
        the New York decoder pin, an amazing feat of pin
        engineering. This is the only pin I've scene that
        justifies having more than one piece. One circular pin is
        attached through another one, creating a movable code
        wheel which matches letters to numbers. There was another
        pin with the encoded message on it. Another new
        innovation was good uses for chains. Instead of simply
        connecting two unrelated pins, Florida used it to make a
        water-skiing flamingo and Kansas made a hot-air balloon
        holding up a basket. </p>
        <p><font size="4">Pin Varieties</font> </p>
        <p>There are many different kinds of pins, of varying
        levels of quality. For the most part you will find OM
        pins. But don't be surprised if you see ones that are
        completely unrelated. </p>
        <p>Don't get pins confused with buttons. This is a no-no
        that I see many new-timers making. A pin is made of thick
        metal and attached with a military clutch. This means a
        sharp point goes through the cloth and has a separate
        unit holding it on. Buttons are made of a flimsy,
        soda-can like metal with a picture glued to it and
        covered with plastic, and have a long pin that goes into
        the cloth and comes back out to reattach to the main
        unit. Pins are normally smaller, heavier, prettier, and
        more valuable.</p>
        <p>There are several different kinds of pins. The
        cheapest ones are plastic ones. Normally the ones you
        find at the worlds have nothing to do with OM. For
        instance, many people last year had green Heinz pickles.
        While they were pretty, they had little real trading
        value. Don't trade too much for these, but if you see one
        you like go for it. The next kind of pin is the photo
        pin. This is a small photo or color printout attached to
        a base with a glass-like epoxy covering over it. The best
        part about this kind of pin is that it offers unlimited
        color and detail. This is the cheapest pin to produce and
        the quality often varies with the approach. I've seen
        some really low quality ones but I've some nice ones. </p>
        <p><img src="ptg-eye.jpg" align="left" hspace="10"
        width="88" height="91">The Edison Eyeballs we made last
        year were really nice and got us some wonderful trades.
        This pin is really cool. If you look in the blood vessels
        of the eyeball you can see that it spells out Edison, NJ
        and has the OM symbol in it. Pins that have more to them
        than just a pretty picture usually are worth more. People
        were offering us their towels for this pin, of course we
        were too ethical to take any such offers.</p>
        <p>Soft enamel and photo etched pins are the next step
        up. You can recognize these by the flat areas of color
        separated by ridges of metal. Examples of these are the
        ever popular Nevada Cards, last year's Pennsylvania
        hands, or the Maine moose. These are more expensive than
        photo pins and have a completely different feel. Normally
        they are well done, but I have seen them misused.</p>
        <p><img src="ptg-belle.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
        width="100" height="123">Hard enamel or cloisonné pins
        are the best. They are shiny, nice to the touch, and very
        sturdy. These pins give the feeling of quality, and are
        the most expensive. A prime example of this type is the
        1996 Mississippi Belle. People go absolutely crazy about
        this pin. If you have the time and money make hard enamel
        pins.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Traditional Favorites</font> </p>
        <p><img src="ptg-catcher.jpg" align="left" hspace="10"
        width="80" height="147">Year to year, there are some pins
        that are always good investments. Their value has been
        proven in competition after competition. When you see
        these blue-chip pins, get them. They include the
        Mississippi Belle (and Beau), Georgia Peach (the glossy
        ones that don't say OM), Nevada Playing Cards, South
        Dakota Dream Catcher, most foreign OM pins, and the
        infamous New Hampshire &quot;NHOM&quot;.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Approaches to Collecting Pins</font> </p>
        <p>There are several approaches to trading. The best is
        simply to go for which ones you like the most. You may
        want one pin from every state, or try to collect the
        biggest pins. </p>
        <p>Whatever your goal is, you'll need to know about the
        values of different pins, and try acquire valuable pins.
        Even if you think a pin's the ugliest thing you've ever
        seen in your entire life, it may be considered valuable.
        You can simply trade it away later on for a pin you like
        more. You may also wish to display your trading savvy by
        prominently displaying valuable pins.</p>
        <p><font size="4">When to Trade</font> </p>
        <p>As soon as you arrive at Maryland, get the permission
        of your coach, and go trading, because the best deals are
        at the beginning. You can actually go up to the busses as
        teams arrive and start trading right away. Most people
        have a horde of pins from their own states, and are eager
        to diversify. Since the comparative value of pins hasn't
        yet been established, this is a good time to get a
        variety of pins from different states. Unload the pins
        you think will be least valuable. Of course, the pins
        you've unloaded could turn out to have been valuable
        ones. This is a risk you'll have to take.</p>
        <p>During the first day or two, when in doubt, make the
        trade. There have been many times that I've had great
        offers right near the beginning and rejected them because
        I didn't like the pin. Of course, later on I found that I
        missed a great deal that could never be repeated because
        the value of the pin went up.</p>
        <p>Make sure you're not missing a team meeting or
        practice! Many times teams get torn apart because members
        are too busy trading instead of practicing spontaneous.
        Remember, you're at the worlds to compete. Trading should
        be second priority.</p>
        <p>By the time the opening ceremonies roll around the
        values of pins will be somewhat established. So if you
        know there's a pin you want from a certain state, the
        time right before and after the ceremonies is the time to
        get it. Look around the coliseum for people from the
        state or country you desire. They will all be sitting in
        the same area wearing the same t-shirt. This is the
        perfect time to get those really valuable pins because if
        someone doesn't like your offer then there are plenty of
        other people to chose from.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Where to Trade</font> </p>
        <p>Where should you trade? It seems that the first big
        place is outside of registration. This however, is only
        at the beginning of the competition. Dorms and cafeterias
        are also good. The only problem with this is that you
        will be limited to the states that share you cafeteria.
        Remember, dorms are assigned by state, and if you stick
        to the same dorm cluster, you'll always be trading with
        people from the same states. Sooner or later, they'll all
        have copies of your state's pins. Quickly acquire the
        pins from your dorm's states, and then venture around the
        campus. The pins that everyone else in your dorm has may
        be rare in another dorm. </p>
        <p>In general, better trades are made when you are
        dealing with a group of people from the same state.
        They've all got the same pins to trade, and where there's
        competition, the price is inevitably lower.</p>
        <p>Remember to bring your pins with you wherever you go.
        Bring them to breakfast, to lunch, and to dinner. Bring
        them to the opening ceremonies, the graduation
        ceremonies, the float and banner parade, and to the
        parties. Bring them to the performances you're watching,
        and bring them to your own team's performance. Trading is
        done anywhere and everywhere, and you always want to be
        ready.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Trading Strategies</font> </p>
        <p>Always keep two sets of pins: a set for display, and a
        reserve set. This way, nobody knows how many pins of each
        type you have. If you have 10 Georgia peaches, and
        display them all, others will see them as less rare, and
        offer you less for them. Keep only one on your towel, and
        the other nine in your backpack. When you complete a
        trade, give them the one off the towel, and make a big
        show of it, especially if you are with a group of people.
        Later, replace the one you traded with one from your bag.
        </p>
        <p><img src="ptg-okla.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
        width="132" height="147">If you already have a lot of
        pins or have some valuable ones you can take it easy.
        Just go to a major pin trading area and set down your
        towel. People will eventually gather around and start
        marveling at your collection, especially if you've been
        to the Worlds before and your collection is sizable.
        They'll soon start making offers. Try negotiating a bit
        and take an offer if you like it.</p>
        <p>If you see a pin that you really want, don't let the
        person who has it know this. Show them your pins and ask
        them what they would trade for that pin. It's surprising
        the deals you can get through this method. You might want
        to offer a pin like your state pin if you still have a
        lot left. Whatever you do, make sure you start low. You
        could get a very good deal without offering too much. If
        offers fail try to see what catches the pin owner's eye.
        Try to work from there. I often have to use one of these
        strategies because New Jersey's boring pins are rarely
        sought after.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you have a pin that is sought
        after, let the desperate people come to you and make
        their offers. If your state has a really valuable pin
        make sure you hold on to a bunch of them because when
        time is running out people are going to offer you their
        entire collection for it. Don't ever do this! It's
        unethical and against the spirit of OM. Even so, there's
        nothing wrong with making a good deal.</p>
        <p>One ultra-competitive strategy is to get someone from
        your team to help you. Go with someone from your team
        into a trading group, but make sure nobody knows he's
        from your team&#151;don't wear the same shirts, for
        instance. Wait until someone makes you an offer. Then,
        your partner will match the offer, plus some small pin.
        Now the other person will have to raise their offer. Take
        it if they do, otherwise pretend to trade with your
        teammate and go to another table or group of people and
        try again. If you tell each other what you want to get
        beforehand, you can work together so each of you can get
        the pins you want.</p>

        width="100" height="114">The best trading strategy is to
        use pin trading to make friends. If you've met someone on
        the Internet, and meet him in person, trade with him. If
        you have an interesting conversation with someone, trade
        with him. If you balance out friendly trading and
        competitive trading, you'll have a good time and a good
        pin collection as well.</p>
        <p>Now that I've given you all this great advice, the
        fruits of trading at five World Competitions, I urge you,
        once you arrive in Maryland, to find me and give me your
        pins!</p>
