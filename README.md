Odyssey of the Mind Site
========================

This is a site I made a long time ago when I was an Odyssey of the Mind coach for my brother's team.

It contains a bunch of spontaneous problems I wrote as well as advice for teams which may or may not still be valuable.

I'm releasing it a open source for any current Odyssey of the Mind teams that might find it useful.
