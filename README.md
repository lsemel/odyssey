Odyssey of the Mind Site
========================

About the site
--------------

This is a site I made a long time ago when I was an Odyssey of the Mind coach for my brother's team.   It contains a bunch of spontaneous problems I wrote as well as advice for teams which may or may not still be valuable.  I'm releasing it a open source for any current Odyssey of the Mind teams that might find it useful.   It features a fun corrugated-cardboard and balsa-wood based theme, inspired by the materials most often used by teams in their solutions.

My first website
----------------

It's also the first real website I ever made.  

The design of this site was pretty advanced for the time, given that it was written for an early version of Netscape which recently introduced such advanced features as repeating background images.

Web designers can can marvel at the non-HTML5-compliant code full of non-semantic, presentational markup, and realize how far Web coding has advanced.
