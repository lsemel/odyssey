        Mistakes Teams Make on Competition Day</font></td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="450"><br>
        In my years of judging OM competitions, I've seen many
        teams make mistakes that they could easily have avoided.
        Here's my list of the most common and costly ones.<br>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Incorrect or incomprehensible style forms</b> </dt>
            <dd>Many teams don't understand style, and fill out
                the style forms incorrectly, or worse,
                incomprehensibly. Style is the elaboration of the
                problem solution, which means you can put down
                for scoring anything you do that add to or
                embellishes the solution to the problem. Many
                teams don't think about what their strongest
                areas are, and put down something ambiguous like
                'Costumes'. What about the costumes? What aspect
                of them makes them special? <p>A very common
                error is to duplicate items already scored in the
                problem. For instance, an Omerdroid team will put
                down 'Humor of the performance'. When this
                happens, I have to ask them to change the style
                forms while they're standing there in the staging
                area. </p>
                <p>For some problems, teams have to submit an
                extra sheet of paper describing some aspect of
                their solution. In Omerdroid, this was a list of
                actions the robot would do. Some teams confuse
                this list with the style form, and put their
                actions on the style form. </p>
                <p>Many teams handwrite the style forms, or make
                bad photocopies, or write very long, unclear
                descriptions of their presentation in the box at
                the bottom. The judges will only have about three
                minutes to read this. If they can't understand
                what you've written, they'll ignore it, to the
                detriment of your team. </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Not having read the rules thoroughly</b> </dt>
            <dd>I've seen so many teams lose points because they,
                or their coaches, obviously haven't read the
                rules. Coaches have asserted to me that the
                tournament director must provide an extension
                cord, but I then I show them the rulebook (and
                ask another team if they could lend them one).
                Teams don't put the right information on their
                membership sign, or don't understand outside
                assistance. Teams will tell me of people who
                quit, and the new people who took their places.<p>Please
                make sure to read the rulebook and the problems
                thoroughly. One team at a recent competition
                entered one problem but solved a different one! </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Making unwarranted assumptions about the
                performance room</b> </dt>
            <dd>Assume the worst. Assume the plugs will be far
                away and you'll need a very long extension cord.
                If your team needs a hard floor, assume
                carpeting. If you need carpeting, assume a hard
                floor. Assume a standard doorway. <p>I've seen
                many teams who panicked because they forgot to
                bring an extension cord, or it wasn't long
                enough, or they couldn't turn off the lights, or
                the judges table was facing the wrong way, or the
                performance area wasn't big enough. </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Not talking loud enough, clear enough, or slow
                enough</b> </dt>
            <dd>Performances often take place in gyms, with awful
                acoustics, or loud fans blowing in the
                background. Teams often mumble their lines, lines
                of a script that's already too complicated to be
                understood by watching it only once. </dd>
            <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
            <dt><b>Staying up the night before</b> </dt>
            <dd>An OM solution is not something you want to do at
                the last minute. The best teams will have taken
                their time, and it shows in their presentations.
                Get a good night's sleep so you can enjoy the day
                ahead. </dd>
