        Yes, with these simple rules, you too can have a Ranatra
        Fusca-winning style presentation, keyed to appeal to the
        specific tastes of the judges. Remember, on your Outside
        Assistance form, list &quot;The Instant OM Style
        Performance Generator&quot; for dozens of extra points. <p><font
        size="5">Theme</font></p>
        <p>A style performance's theme sets the entire mood of
        your performance. Thus, it is the most important choice
        you must make. To impress the judges, your theme must be
        happily upbeat. It must not reflect any problems in the
        world or controversial issues, or anything else about the
        world. Avoid these themes at all costs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violence </li>
            <li>The Environment </li>
            <li>Race </li>
            <li>Gender </li>
            <li>Abortion </li>
            <li>Sex </li>
            <li>Religion </li>
            <li>Drugs </li>
            <li>Music </li>
            <li>Literature </li>
            <li>Art </li>
            <li>History </li>
            <li>Politics </li>
            <li>Love </li>
            <li>The Family </li>
            <li>School </li>
            <li>Work </li>
            <li>All intellectual pursuits </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.odyssey.org/odyssey"><b>OM</b></a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We suggest you select your performance's theme from
        the following list: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hercules</li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="5">Story</font></p>
        <p>After selecting your theme, you need to elaborate it.
        This usually involves developing an appealing story, with
        appealing characters. Select the best-looking member of
        your team. This person will play &quot;The
        Princess&quot;. Don't worry if your team's best-looking
        member is a male; if so, you're doubly lucky, because
        you'll get extra creativity points for transvestitism.
        Now, you need to develop a story around the princess.
        Choose from one of the following, depending on the type
        of long-term you're doing: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The princess is kidnapped by an evil frog. After
                several Broadway showtunes with lyrics rewritten
                by the team, he realizes the <a
                href="../zzzz.html"><b>error</b></a><b> </b>of
                his ways. </li>
            <li>The princess meets Dr. Seuss, Mickey Mouse, and
                Omer. They sing a song extolling creativity. </li>
            <li>The princess gets in a hydraulic powered car and
                drives around for eight minutes. After several
                Broadway showtunes with lyrics rewritten by the
                team, she realizes the error of her ways. </li>
            <li>The princess performs a skit while a structure is
                being crushed. There is no relation whatsoever
                between the two scenes. </li>
            <li>The princess remains in character after the skit
                ends. As you discuss your solution with judges,
                insist that s/he is a real princess. Invoke the
                divine right of kings to order the judges to give
                you extra points. Fight with the prince, who is a
                foppish, boring man with numerous adulterous
                affairs. Threaten to divorce him. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="5">Scenery</font></p>
        <p>It is important that your scenery look as slick and
        well finished as possible, yet still seem to be made by
        the team. It must look like it could fall apart at any
        instant, yet its technical execution must resemble that
        of a fine artist. Remember, artistic skill and creativity
        are one and the same.</p>
        <p>Conversely, you may also make your scenery entirely
        out of garbage. </p>
        <p>Where shall your skit take place? The more fantastic,
        the better. The best place is a land of happy fairies,
        rivers of chocolate and candy-cane trees. One notch below
        is a forest full of cute little creatures and talking
        fauna. Outer space, while not up to fairyland standards,
        has its possibilities also. The prehistoric past is also
        fair game. The rule of thumb is: if it was shown in a
        popular Disney movie, go with it. Places with
        &quot;accepted cultural value&quot; suffice: museums and
        theaters are tenable choices. The worst places for your
        skit to take place are banal places: city streets,
        offices, school buildings, karate studios (gasp!),
        military bases (gasp! gasp!), garbage-strewn alleys
        (triple gasp!). But worst of all is to use abstract
        scenery done just for its aesthetic appeal. Judges won't
        understand it, and judges don't like what they don't
        understand.</p>
        <p><font size="5">Devices and Vehicles</font></p>
        <p>Having machines that work perfectly, no matter how
        conventional, is key to winning. A working device is more
        creative than a creative device. To make your banal
        devices seem like wonders of the imagination, follow
        these guidelines:</p>
        <p>Make sure your devices look as if they can't possibly
        work. Leave the wood outside overnight in the mud before
        you build. Have parts hanging off. Better yet,
        incorporate extra parts into the devices that can fall
        off during the performance, and have a team member
        pretend to scramble to reassemble the device before it
        fails. Have him use chewing gum he's strategically been
        chewing to repair the machine, or have him break off his
        shoelaces to tie a part on. What creativity! When the
        machine works, everyone will be amazed. Amidst the
        riotous applause, relish the Ranatra Fusca you'll be
        getting.</p>
        <p>Be sure use a flimsy material like cardboard,
        Styrofoam, or dried spaghetti and index cards. If your
        machines big and have many odd, noise-making parts (not
        loud noises, just quiet, weird ones), as well as blinking
        lights, they have a good chance. If they makes bubbles
        they can hardly lose. Remember, bubbles are creative.
        Creativity isn't creative. </p>
        <p><font size="5">Fine Art</font></p>
        <p>Some problems call for the use of art. Or you may want
        to incorporate some art into your solution. Remember, the
        only art suitable for use in OM skits is French
        Impressionism, because: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Judges think it's beautiful </li>
            <li>They are familiar with it already from their
                coffee-table books </li>
            <li>It has no social, political, or religious content
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Never use modern (abstract) art, because the judges
        won't like it. Never use art with any social, political,
        or religious content. This includes all other styles.</p>
        <p>OM has done us all a service with its Great
        Impressions problem for next year, as it requires the use
        of French Impressionism. We should see many good,
        interesting skits full of water lilies, Japanese bridges,
        haystacks, and ballet dancers. Oh boy! </p>
        <p><font size="5">Music</font></p>
        <p>It is common knowledge that it is <b>much</b> more
        creative to change the lyrics of a popular song than to
        write an original one. If you write an original one, the
        judges will think you're too smart, thus immediately
        deducting points. OM is <b>not</b> about smartness, it is
        about creativity, which writing an original song is not.</p>
        <p><font size="5">Costumes</font></p>
        <p>You're most likely going to get judged on the
        appearance of one team member. Again, make sure to use
        your best-looking team member. Check out the judges on
        competition day. If there are more male judges, designate
        a female to be judged. And, of course, vice versa.</p>
        <p>Here are some guidelines for making costumes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember, you are allowed to wear street clothes
                without cost. Put on hundreds of layers of street
                clothes and, after time starts, rearrange them to
                become costumes. An ordinary t-shirt can become a
                sling, a turban, a bandanna, etc. Design your
                long term problem solution entirely out of street
                clothes. (Note: now street clothes count toward
                cost.)</li>
            <li>Wear t-shirts with every letter of the alphabet
                on them, so if you get a <a
                href="../spont/non_verbal.html"><b>non-verbal
                spontaneous problem</b></a>, you can point to the
                letters as a communication system. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="5">Overall Effect</font></p>
        <p>By diligently following these guidelines, you will be
        assured of gaining the full 10 points for overall effect,
        as well as the scorn of your competitors, who tried to
        come up with something &quot;original&quot; and lost. </p>
        <p>We hope you find these guidelines useful, and really
        look forward to seeing the skits you devise based on
        them. <i>Really</i>. </p>

            the 4th grade. Which makes this my 9th year. I've
            done classics every one of those nine years. It was
            incredible when I read some of your stuff and
            realized how universal these feelings are. It seems
            that every year, we come up with all kinds of great
            jokes, but then end up pulling them because they'd go
            right over the judges' heads. </font></p>

            read your style guidelines and thought that they rang
            very true. Maybe a few things to add: under
            characters, you should put in a part about the prince
            (or princess) getting into a swordfight. hardly
            anything is as &quot;creative&quot; as your very own
            choreographed swordplay. also, under props and
            scenery, I believe that one of my favorite quotes
            applies very well. &quot;Duct tape is like the Force.
            It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the
            universe together.&quot; Anyway, have you ever
            wondered where OM skits would bee if it weren't for
            cardboard refrigerator boxes, duct tape, and spray
            paint? I mean, without those, a person would actually
            have to do some creative scenery making, and we all
            know how OMers feel about that. Anyway, keep up the
            good work with your page. </font></p>

            above all OM judges believe everyone is beneath them,
            if something is presented by a team and is not
            understood by all the judges, then it must not be
            creative, automatic loss of points. Also do not
            expect the judges to have everything set up properly.
            More than likely they will not measure the courses
            correctly or they will strategically place your
            performance area under a basketball hoop. OM judges
            are also known for their legendary gullibility. You
            can by a $100 dollar engine, and with the right
            amount of added grease and a couple of dents you can
            convince them you bought it for $20 bucks at a yard
            sale. The most important rule to remember when
            dealing with OM judges is this, they all have god
            complexes. If they feel you are insubordinate, if you
            commit such unforgivable crimes as not laughing at
            their OM jokes or not thanking them for words of
            advice you have already heard 10 times, they will
            strike you down by taking massive points away form
            all areas of you score and give you the most
            terrifying of all punishments: a &quot;I did my best,
            I'm a winner&quot; ribbon as you learn how many
            points the other teams all had. </font></p>

            was in OM in 1990, and we had a skit for Omitronic
            Humor, where I played a psychodoctor. The entire skit
            was slapstick humor. I remember the audience laughing
            at all of our humor but the judges obviously don't
            like slapstick. If I remember correctly, the skit
            that beat us was 'Green Eggs and Hamlet'. It was very
            serious and boring. The next year, a girl came up to
            me at an OM competition and asked for Dr. Jeff's
            autograph! This made me both happy and sad. Happy,
            because we had such a memorable skit, some ordinary
            schmoe remembered it and wanted my autograph. Sad, or
            rather very upset, that we had such a memorable skit
            and the judges thought it was bad. </font></p>
