            <p>As we all know, the ability to aim is essential to
            creativity. Practice throwing pennies and other small
            objects into cups, onto paper plates, etc. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>Emphasizing Creativity</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>On a &quot;Name things that...&quot; problem, to
            emphasize creativity as opposed to pure speed, give
            each team member 5 index cards. The team has the same
            amount of time to respond, but responses can be in
            any order, and upon giving a response, that team
            member surrenders an index card. Use a 5, 3, and 1
            point scoring system to distinguish different levels
            of creativity. </p>

        <p><b>Speed Spontaneous</b> (Submitted by <a

        <blockquote>
            <p>Split the team into groups of four, or preferably
            three. Let two or three team members compete, and the
            others judge. Give the competing team members a <a
            href="verbal.html">verbal</a> problem, with the usual
            rules. When they are done, rotate members so the
            judges get a chance. This not only builds speed, but
            forces team members to focus on the thinking time, as
            there is almost no time to think between answers.
            (Two of my teammates and I have tested this method
            the day before competition, and found it very
            helpful.) </p>

        Solutions<br>
        </font>by <a href="mailto:lsemel@superlink.net"><strong>Lee
        Semel</strong></a></p>
        <p>The problems below are intended to be run as
        spontaneous problems, with each team member giving an
        answer in turn. Their goal is to help the team come up
        with ideas they can use for their long-term solution.
        This is the brainstorming process, which spontaneous is
        supposed to teach. The responses should come as quick as
        possible, with no editing. When a team member is stuck,
        the team is stuck. You should tape-record the responses
        the team comes up with, so the ideas generated can be
        used. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Name things you are interested in, and would like
                to learn more about. </li>
            <li>Name things that you can obtain for free. Name
                things that cost under $1. </li>
            <li>Describe ways to attach two things together. </li>
            <li>Describe ways things can be made compact. </li>
            <li>You are moving things around and setting things
                up. What can you do to keep an audience
                entertained while this is going on? </li>
            <li>Name things you know how to do, or are good at
                doing. Can you think of ways to incorporate what
                you're already good at into your solution? For
                instance, a student on one of Matt's teams knew
                how to build geometric structures made of
                triangles of metal tubing. They found a way to
                incorporate such a structure into their
                solution's style performance. You may have your
                own unique knowledge or unusual skills. </li>
            <li>You have (insert object here) only. How many ways
                could you use it in a presentation? Try this
                problem with different, common and unusual
                objects: a cardboard box, a piece of wood, a toy
                car, a skateboard, a bag of leaves, a computer,
                3D glasses, a vacuum cleaner, etc. </li>
            <li>Name things that can be worn. </li>
            <li>People often wear things that say something about
                them. For instance, a policeman carries a badge,
                a fireman wears a red helmet, a businessman has a
                tie. Think of different kinds of people, and what
                you'd need to wear in order to pretend to be that
                kind of person. </li>
            <li>Think of ordinary things that can make sounds. </li>
            <li>Watch a movie. How do the sounds and music
                enhance the story? How would the feel of the
                movie change if the sounds and music were
                different? </li>
            <li>How can you convey a place? Choose a place and
                think about its essential characteristics. Is it
                indoors or out? Bright or dim? Noisy or quiet?
                Are there certain kinds of furniture, or styles
                of buildings? Is it best depicted with detailed
                cardboard scenery flats, or with a single piece
                of furniture? Or a sign? Could it be shown using
                sound alone? What about smell? </li>
            <li>Advertisers often take ordinary products and use
                creative ways of promoting them. Think of TV
                commercials for ordinary products, like cola,
                cereal, sneakers, etc. How do they add pizzazz
                and excitement to the product? How do they make
                you remember their product? Can you use this
                method to add style to your own solution? </li>
            <li>Name things that someone who is 40 likes. Name
                things someone who is 40 dislikes. Name things
                that someone who is your age likes. How are they
                different from what older people like? </li>
            <li>Name things that can go wrong in a long-term
                presentation, and ways to prepare for them. </li>
