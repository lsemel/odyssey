        Nothing More Than Feeling</b> by <a
        href="mailto:lsemel@superlink.net"><strong>Lee Semel</strong></a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Summary</em>: The team is presented with five
                boxes, into which they can reach to feel an item
                inside. The team members must respond to what
                they feel inside the boxes.</li>
            <li><i>Setup:</i> Before think time begins, give each
                team member three sets of cards numbered 1
                through 5, and two cards marked &#145;Free&#146;.
                Place the numbers 1 through 5 on each of five
                boxes, with holes cut in the top. Fill the boxes
                with different, vile materials. For example, fill
                box 1 with wet spaghetti, box 2 with Jell-O, box
                3 with sand, box 4 with Ping-Pong balls, and box
                5 with feathers.</li>
            <li><i>Problem:</i> Five numbered boxes have been
                placed before you, each with a different item
                inside. At any time you may reach into the holes
                to feel what is inside the boxes. Your problem is
                to respond to what you feel inside the boxes.</li>
            <li>You may not look inside the boxes, and you may
                not move the boxes or remove their contents.</li>
            <li>Any team member may respond at any time. Only one
                team member may respond at a time.</li>
            <li>Each team member will receive a set of numbered
                cards, and two cards marked &#145;Free&#146;.
                When you want to respond to the contents of a
                box, you must give the judges a card with the
                appropriate box number, and make your response.
                Cards marked &#145;Free&#146; may be used to
                respond to any box. Once you use up all the cards
                of a given number, you may no longer respond to
                that box. You may not give or trade cards with
                your teammates.</li>
            <li>You will have 1 minute to think and 4 minutes to
                respond. You mayreach into the boxes during think
                time.</li>
            <li><i>Scoring:</i> You will receive 1 point for each
                common response, 5 points for each creative or
                humorous response.</li>
            <li><em>Examples:</em><em><strong> </strong></em>Common
                responses include saying what the objects seem to
                be (i.e. spaghetti, ping pong balls) or
                describing simple properties of the objects (wet,
                round). Creative responses include imagining the
                objects to be other objects (guts, brains, a box
                of eyeballs, a colony of worms), incorporating
                the feeling (this seems to be a sticky
                situation), incorporating the box (beach in a
                box, just add water), relating the items in
                different boxes <font size="2">&quot;</font>This
                box contains the ashes of a dead person &#133;
                This box contains his eyeballs&#133; This box
                contains his intestines &#133; This box contains
                his brains&quot;, things said by the item in the
                box (hey let go!).</li>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Problem:</em> These objects (show two unusual
                object) has been dug up from the ground together.
                What could they have been or done? </li>
            <li><em>Setup:</em> Give each team member 10 cards.
                They can respond whenever they want, but have to
                surrender a card for each response. </li>
            <li><em>Timing &amp; Scoring: </em>Three minutes to
                answer, 1 point for common answers, 5 points for
                creative. After 4 minutes, switch the objects to
                two new, even more unusual objects, and repeat.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>You will have 5 minutes to discuss and this
                problem and prepare solutions. Questions count
                against your time.</li>
            <li>Each team member will be given an 8.5 by 11 piece
                of colored paper, a pencil, two paper clips, a
                ruler, and a piece of tape. These are the only
                materials you are allowed to use to solve this
                problem. Spoken words may not be part of the
                solutions, but team members may speak to each
                other.</li>
            <li>At the end of the five minutes, each team member
                will present two solutions to the judges.</li>
            <li>Team members may discuss the problem with each
                other, but may not exchange materials.</li>
            <li>Your problem is to indicate, show, or explain,
                using the materials provided, things that are
                dangerous.</li>
            <li>You will be scored as follows:<br>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Perform two presentations involving the selling of
            a used car (give the team a photograph of an old,
            junked car). Eight minutes total. 1-20 for the
            creativity of each presentation, 1-10 for how well
            the used car is incorporated into the presentations,
            1-10 for teamwork.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>Object Pairs</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Assemble a set of five unusual objects. Some
            should have an identifiable purpose, while others
            should be more ambiguous (machine or toy parts, for
            example). With the usual times and scoring procedure,
            the problem is for each team member, in turn, to pick
            up two of the objects and respond to them. (Some
            teams have trouble when told to &quot;respond&quot;
            to something. Give them examples, i.e. show how two
            objects can be used together, imagine they are
            something else, throw them at another team member and
            say &quot;They're projectiles&quot;, scream and say
            &quot;My lord! A ___ and ___! Run for your
            lives&quot;. Basically do or say something involving
            the objects.) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>Object Pairs: Harder</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Place each object by a number. Each team member,
            upon his or her turn, picks an index card with two
            numbers printed on it, indicating which objects to
            respond to. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
        <b>Stories</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Assemble a set of unusual objects. The team has 4
            minutes to plan and 4 minutes to perform for score.
            They must devise two stories, and must incorporate
            the objects into the stories. When scoring time
            starts, one team member starts a story, and the
            others respond in turn. When each team member has
            responded twice, the next story begins, with the same
            procedure. Score 1-5 for creativity of each response,
            1-10 for the quality of each story, and 1-10 for the
            quality of each story's ending.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
        <b>Stories with Foil</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Same as the previous problem, but instead of
            objects, give each team member a square of aluminum
            foil. During the first 4 minutes they can shape the
            foil any way they choose. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
        <b>Stories: Harder</b> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Use common, &quot;functionally-fixed&quot; objects
            instead of unusual ones. This will make it harder for
            teams to come up with really creative responses. </p>
